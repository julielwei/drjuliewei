[**Dr. Wei&#8217;s Bio**][2]

**Overview of [A Healthier Wei][3]**

An increasing number of children are suffering from Ear, Nose and Throat complaints each year, and many of them are put on medication, or referred for painful and intrusive surgery. ENT Specialist, Dr. Julie Wei, believes there is a better way – a healthier way – to cure these common complaints. In her experience treating 4600+ children each year, she has come to believe that simple and easy changes to diet and lifestyle can eliminate the need for medicine and surgery altogether.

Dr. Julie Wei is a pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist and the author of [A Healthier Wei][4]. As a mother herself, Dr. Wei is a passionate advocate for improving children's health through better diet and dietary habits. She has been committed to helping parents learn how to eliminate their child's ear, nose, and throat problems simply by reducing excessive sugar and dairy intake, as well as minimizing habitual late night snacking. She hopes to raise awareness for the need for accountability by both medical professionals and parents to ensure that children are not prescribed or take unnecessary medications long term. 

When she is not in the clinic, operating room, or conducting research, you will find her in the kitchen preparing food with love along with her daughter Claire. If you sit next to her on the plane, she will likely share with you information about how to minimize choking hazards in young children, and many other tips for improving your child's health.
