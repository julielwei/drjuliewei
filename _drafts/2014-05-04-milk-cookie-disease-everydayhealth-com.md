There are so many great websites, foundations, platforms, programs, and initiatives that are already fighting for better health for children,  and behind all of them are individuals who believe in the power of education, inspiration, and[ making positive changes][5].

Dr. Julie Wei is a pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist and the author of [A Healthier Wei][6]. As a mother herself, Dr. Wei is a passionate advocate for improving children's health through better diet and dietary habits. She has been committed to helping parents learn how to eliminate their child's ear, nose, and throat problems simply by reducing excessive sugar and dairy intake, as well as minimizing habitual late night snacking. She hopes to raise awareness for the need for accountability by both medical professionals and parents to ensure that children are not prescribed or take unnecessary medications long term. 

When she is not in the clinic, operating room, or conducting research, you will find her in the kitchen preparing food with love along with her daughter Claire. If you sit next to her on the plane, she will likely share with you information about how to minimize choking hazards in young children, and many other tips for improving your child's health.
