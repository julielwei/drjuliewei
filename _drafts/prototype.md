Add a title and underline it
----------------------------

Type some text and maybe
> add a block quote.

You can add a list with number like this:
* first list item
* second list item
* and add as many as you like
* as long as it starts with * and a space

You can even add a numbered list like this:
1. First item
2. Second item
3.  but you'll notice 
1. that the numbers don't really matter
9. because it will renumber them all anyway
5. so the numbers are sequential.

If you want a horizontal line that goes across the page try three asterisks on a line by themselves:
***

If you want to link to something put it in hard parens with the url in soft parens afterward.  So [this is a link](http://to.this.site/).  Wasn't that easy?  Images are just about the same, except you use an exclamation point first.  So to insert an image ![This is 'alt' text if the browser can't display the image](http://this.is.the.link/to-an-image.jpg "and a title, if you want one")

You can italicize to words with *asterisks before and after*  or bold them with **double asterisks, if you prefer**. If you want to type and asterisk just use a slash first \*.
