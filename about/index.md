Dr. Julie Wei is a Pediatric Otolaryngologist (an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for children) who believes every child has the right to symptom-free breathing and sleeping.

Through her medical work, she has found that many ENT problems can be controlled simply and easily through a basic diet and lifestyle change. Unfortunately, millions of children are being misdiagnosed and overmedicated each year because of a lack of education in this area.

Dr. Julie’s goal with her new book, A Healthier Wei is to show parents that there is a better way – a healthier way – to treat common symptoms associated with ENT complications, and that children can reclaim their health with medicine and surgery being a last resort.

Dr. Julie discusses what she has coined the “Milk and Cookie Disease” as a common factor for many of the complaints she sees in patients; the idea being that when a child eats is as an important factor as what they eat. Her philosophies are driven by a blend of Eastern wisdom coupled with Western medical expertise; Dr. Julie was born in Taiwan and later immigrated to the US with her family when she was 10.

The recommendations and guidelines in her work and in the book do not involve deprivation or complicated preparation. Being a working mother herself, Dr. Julie understands the demands of a busy family life. The simple guidelines for eating and living set out in A Healthier Wei are forward-thinking and much-needed, and have – and will continue to have – a big impact on thousands of children’s well-beings across the globe.
