              <strong>‘It’s almost a miracle how simple it was. It’s been amazing.” </strong><em>Lynn Crist on adopting A Healthier Wei.</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Dr. Julie Wei believes that many children suffering from runny noses, allergy symptoms and sore throats are being misdiagnosed and overmedicated. In her book, <em>A Healthier Wei</em>, the Ear, Nose and Throat specialist and surgeon suggests a simpler way – a healthier way – to cure these common complaints and turn a young person’s life around.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Dr. Wei’s Asian roots taught her that “what goes in the mouth goes out in health.” This, combined with extensive, specialized medical training she has helped thousands of children reclaim a healthy lifestyle through diet and what she deems “Milk and Cookie Disease.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Her recommendations are not one of deprivation, nor advocating the “perfect” diet; rather she uses wisdom from both Eastern and Western medicine to suggest simple and manageable guidelines such as no snacks after 7pm and serving milk at lunch rather than dinner. She does not criticize the Western diet or suggest major changes, rather Dr. Julie advocates that the timing and schedule of eating meals and snacks is often overlooked, yet is just as important as making healthy food choices.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              A working mother herself, Dr. Julie understands the challenges that a busy weekly schedule poses, and is realistic about creating a diet and lifestyle that is both achievable and uncomplicated. The book teaches parents how to read food labels, how to choose the right snacks, and includes simple recipes for parents to follow. Her recipes are healthy, quick and easy; and best of all contain only a handful of ingredients.

            <p>
              In her just self-published book, Julie uses the relationships in her life to make her case with a certainty that only those of us who believe in wisdom gained from experience can do. And in doing so, she teaches not only about how patients can live in a healthier way, but also how women physicians can have their voices heard using non-traditional models of communication. Heart-based and health-based.<br /> …<br /> She did it by caring about other people. Listening to them. Giving them the best that she has. She gave to her family, her patients and her colleagues. Photographs of important people, from the kids in her clinic to her own child, reversing roles on a most beautiful cover photograph, chronicle her journey of discovery with the people who gave her the strength, the courage and the opportunities to make these discoveries. As a woman physician, I learned as much about the importance of relationships as I did about her core message of how to reclaim health for our children who are misdiagnosed and overmedicated.<br /> <a href="http://www.womenmdresources.com/self-publishing-creates-new-avenues-for-women-physician-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank"><strong>Read the full review by Linda Brodsky, MD</strong></a>

Dr. Julie Wei is a pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist and the author of [A Healthier Wei][1]. As a mother herself, Dr. Wei is a passionate advocate for improving children's health through better diet and dietary habits. She has been committed to helping parents learn how to eliminate their child's ear, nose, and throat problems simply by reducing excessive sugar and dairy intake, as well as minimizing habitual late night snacking. She hopes to raise awareness for the need for accountability by both medical professionals and parents to ensure that children are not prescribed or take unnecessary medications long term. 

When she is not in the clinic, operating room, or conducting research, you will find her in the kitchen preparing food with love along with her daughter Claire. If you sit next to her on the plane, she will likely share with you information about how to minimize choking hazards in young children, and many other tips for improving your child's health.
