It&#8217;s 4pm in Orlando, a gorgeous day, and here is Claire after we all enjoyed a Skinny Cow Salted Carmel Pretzel ice cream bar! Love her chocolate mustache.  I must admit, I went a while without eating ice cream, knowing how full of fat, sugar, and calories and trying not to start the habit. However, what&#8217;s summer without ice cream! So these awesome bars have 160 calories, 9 grams of fat, 13 grams of sugar, and we love having them in the afternoon instead of night time.

Since the move, we pretty much always have a variety of ice cream and ice cream treats in the freezer, both of them (old refrigerator from previous home owners now in garage for extra storage). I blame my dear friend Liz, who was our neighbor back in Leawood Kansas whose family we adore. One night after dinner with Liz, Chris, Anna, and Colin, Liz brought out 3 kinds of ice cream bars, and there I fell in love with the Snicker&#8217;s Ice cream bars! I think the fact that there were so many choices, including Klondike original and Dove&#8217;s mini ice cream bars, made me gitty and truly appreciate how fun ice cream is. I decided to be a fun mom and have used summer, and the move to hot/humid Florida to justify purchasing a few variety of cool summer treats. We also love Dole&#8217;s coconut fruit bars.  Then there is the Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars! ugh, I swear it tastes so good going down then I feel couple hundred pounds heavier right after eating it!

We invited new friends over for dinner after 3 weeks of being here, and I made two ice cream &#8220;pies&#8221;.

**Carmel Ice Cream Pie**

One pre-made Oreo Cookie Pie Crust  
1 container of Edy&#8217;s slow churned Caramel Delight ice cream  
1 container of Cool Whip

Let ice cream soften, scoop into shell, gently push down into pie shell with flat spatula.

**Java Chip Frappucino Ice Cream Pie &#8211; for Adults!**

One pre-made Oreo Cookie Pie Crust  
2 small containers of Starbuck&#8217;s Java Chip Frappucino Ice Cream (coffee ice cream)  
1 container of Cool Whip

Let ice cream soften, scoop into pie shell, top with cool whip and then cover/freeze.  Drizzle slices with chocolate fudge sauce/caramel sauce.

We also discovered &#8220;Menchie&#8217;s&#8221; here since our arrival.

It&#8217;s a chain where you go and simply fill your &#8220;cup&#8221; with frozen yogurt (many flavors) and then add any topping you want (there are many choices), and pay for your treat based on weight.  We&#8217;ve only gone twice but every time it is packed! Tuesdays are free waffle cone days but don&#8217;t be fooled, it&#8217;s really not free since you&#8217;re paying for it&#8217;s weight as it occupies the cup. However, your&#8217;re at least not paying extra for the waffle cookie itself. Claire of course ordered the ridiculously artificial blue &#8220;Smurf&#8221; flavor/color frozen yogurt our first time there, but realized that my objections were valid as she tasted the tart and artificial flavor. Now we do the vanilla/chocolate swirl, and keep it simple with little hot fudge and of course, 2 red marachino cherries!

When we were in Kansas, it was not hard to stop the ice cream habit once summer is over. However, I must admit  that Florida and it&#8217;s likely gorgeous warm weather as fall and winter approaches may pose a challenge in stopping our love affair with ice cream. But hey, at least we are eating it earlier! Enjoy what&#8217;s left of summer&#8230;..and all the cold creamy treats that help to make special memories of our lives <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
